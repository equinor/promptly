Gerald Sussman (MIT CSAIL) wrote [a PhD thesis (LINK)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/planning/readings/AITR-297.pdf) entitled, _A Computational Model of Skill Acquisition_, dated August 1973. 

Here is the abstract:

The thesis contains some images describing a scene, plus some text decribing a task to be performed, eg by a robot. These examples could form a small benchmark for testing the planning capabilities of AIs

This folder contains the relevant figures, along with the actual text Sussman gave.

The so-called [Sussman anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussman_anomaly) starts with the figure shown in `problem_1-3-a.png`, which is a solution to problem 1.3.
