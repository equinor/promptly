Of course, it would be entirely possible to write a suite of tests that will all fail for this model too, or a suite which would all pass.

Concealment  \\n  • Hiding small items in coats, inside bags or under bulky clothing  \\n  • Stashing trinkets in prams, diaper bags or large purses  \\n  • Using “booster bags” (foil-lined totes that foil anti-theft gates)  \\n\\n2. Tag-tampering or Removal  \\n  • Quick use of magnets or tag-detachers to pop off security labels  \\n  • Cutting or tearing price tags off merchandise in a quiet corner  \\n\\n3. Distraction Techniques  \\n  • One person engages you with questions or requests, while an accomplice rifles the shelves  \\n  • Sudden “accidents” (spilling coffee, dropping merchandise) diverting attention  \\n\\n4. Price-switching & Barcode Tricks  \\n  • Swapping barcodes or price tags—putting a low-price tag on a higher-value item  \\n  • Placing a tag on the floor or hidden on the rack to later scan at checkout  \\n\\n5. “Grab-and-Run” or “Flash Mob”  \\n  • A quick dash: snatch a handful of small items (keychains, magnets, postcards) and bolt  \\n  • Coordinated group thefts—one group causes a distraction while others load up  \\n\\n6. Fitting-Room or Behind-Shelf Stashing  \\n  • Taking items into a fitting room or behind large displays, then walking out empty-handed  \\n  • Bins and end-caps make easy hiding spots  \\n\\n7. Over-layering Clothing or “Dressing for Steal”  \\n  • Wearing multiple sweaters or jackets to hide small souvenirs in folds  \\n  • Oversized clothing worn year-round, even in warm weather  \\n\\n8. Use of Children or Pets as Shields  \\n  • Shoppers with kids in tow—kids used to smuggle small items out in stroller baskets  \\n  • Pets (real or carried in carriers) that block staff view  \\n\\n9. Return-and-Exchange Fraud  \\n  • Bringing in unpurchased or broken goods, demanding full refund  \\n  • Claiming they bought similar items on a previous visit and “lost” the receipt  \\n\\n10. Nervous or “Too Friendly” Behavior  \\n   • Excessive camera-scanning—checking where cameras and staff are positioned  \\n   • Frequent in-and-out visits during a short period, often circling back to the same rack  \\n   • Overly chatty or complimentary to lower your guard  \\n\\nWhat you can do:  \\n• Greet every customer as they enter—acknowledgment alone deters many casual shoplifters.  \\n• Keep high-value trinkets behind glass or on locked displays.  \\n• Train staff to work in pairs when restocking and to maintain sightlines to changing rooms.  \\n• Use mirrors or CCTV to cover blind spots (behind displays, tall shelving).  \\n• Post clear “No Shoplifting” signs and let would-be thieves know you’re watching.  \\n\\nBy recognizing these behaviors you’ll not only cut losses but also create an environment where shoplifting feels too risky to attempt.'"

In the frequency domain it has a rectangular (or trapezoidal if you taper it) spectrum, and in the time domain it looks like a sinc‐type wavelet with fairly strong side‐lobes.  \\n\\nWhen to use a Klauder wavelet  \\n•  If you really are simulating vibroseis acquisition (sweeps followed by cross‐correlation), the Klauder wavelet is the correct physical model—just generate your sweep and correlate it with itself.  \\n•  It lets you dial in start/stop frequencies and sweep length exactly as in the field.  \\n\\nWhen you might choose something simpler  \\n•  In most 3D marine streamer data (North Sea air‐gun surveys, zero‐phase processing), the actual wavelet is smoother and has much less ringing than a rectangular‐band chirp\\xad–auto‐correlation.  \\n•  For quick synthetic tests people almost always use a zero‐phase Ricker or an Ormsby wavelet (i.e. a trapezoidal band‐limited spectrum) because they:  \\n   –  Have controlled bandwidth & negligible side‐lobes  \\n   –  Are trivial to code and parameterize (just pick a peak frequency or four corner freqs)  \\n   –  Better mimic the filtered air‐gun signature + processing.  \\n\\nIf you do want a Klauder, here’s a sketch in Python:  \\n```\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom scipy.signal import chirp\\n\\n# parameters\\nfs    = 200.0        # sampling rate (Hz)\\nT     = 10.0         # sweep length (s)\\nf1, f2 = 5.0, 80.0   # start and end freq of sweep (Hz)\\n\\n# time axis\\ndt = 1.0/fs\\nt_sweep = np.arange(0, T, dt)\\n\\n# make the linear FM sweep\\nsweep = chirp(t_sweep, f0=f1, t1=T, f1=f2, method='linear')\\n\\n# auto-correlate to get the zero‐phase Klauder wavelet\\nw = np.correlate(sweep, sweep, mode='full')\\nt_w = np.arange(-len(sweep)+1, len(sweep)) * dt\\n\\n# normalize\\nw /= np.max(np.abs(w))\\n\\n# now you can convolve w with your reflectivity series r:\\n#   seismogram = np.convolve(r, w, mode='same')\\n```\\n\\nA few practical tips if you go Klauder:  \\n1)  Taper the band edges in the frequency domain (make the rectangular spectrum a trapezoid or use a smooth cosine taper) to suppress side‐lobes.  \\n2)  Center the auto‐correlated wavelet on zero (it comes out symmetric around t=0).  When you convolve you may need to shift it so that the “zero-lag” lines up with your first sample.  \\n3)  If your goal is simply “look like real North Sea data,” pick a Ricker/Ormsby with a 20–60\\u2009Hz bandwidth (e.g. f1=15, f2=20, f3=60, f4=70\\u2009Hz) and you’ll get a much more realistic wavelet (and far less ringing) than with a hard‐edged Klauder.\\n\\nIn summary:  \\n–  Yes, the Klauder wavelet is the physically‐correct choice for vibroseis‐style modeling.  \\n–  For “standard” marine streamer data over the North Sea, you’ll often get better, simpler results with Ricker or Ormsby‐type wavelets.\""

       "'Here’s a side-by-side look at Macau vs. Monaco—with an eye on stepping away from the casino scene and soaking up everything else each place has to offer. At the end you’ll find a few tips on making the trip more of a “reset” than a return to old habits.\\n\\n1. Travel logistics  \\n   • Getting there  \\n     – Macau: Fly into Hong Kong (major hub), then 1 hr ferry or 1 hr+ land-crossing.  No visa for many nationalities up to 30–90 days.  \\n     – Monaco: Fly into Nice Côte d’Azur (major European hub), then 30 min train or car. Schengen visa rules apply for non-EU visitors.  \\n   • Costs  \\n     – Macau: Generally cheaper lodging, dining, taxis.  \\n     – Monaco: One of Europe’s priciest spots—hotels, restaurants and taxis all premium-priced.  \\n\\n2. Climate & timing  \\n   • Macau: Subtropical—hot, humid summers; mild winters. Best April–May or Sept–Oct.  \\n   • Monaco: Mediterranean—warm summers; mild, wetter winters. Best May–June or Sept.  \\n\\n3. Language & culture  \\n   • Macau: Cantonese, Portuguese and English. Fusion of Chinese temples and Portuguese-style plazas.  \\n   • Monaco: French and English. Glitzy Riviera vibe, royal palace, luxury yachts—but also Provençal markets and olive groves up in the hills.  \\n\\n4. Non-gambling highlights  \\n   Macau:  \\n     • UNESCO sites—Ruins of St. Paul’s, A-Ma Temple, Senado Square.  \\n     • Coloane Island—beaches, village feel, Hac Sa black-sand beach, trekking.  \\n     • Food adventure—dim sum spots, egg-tarts, Macau-style Portuguese chicken.  \\n     • Taipa Villa and charming lanes ideal for wandering and street-food hopping.  \\n\\n   Monaco (and nearby Riviera):  \\n     • Oceanographic Museum and Exotic Gardens perched on the cliff.  \\n     • Prince’s Palace and daily changing of the guard.  \\n     • Larvotto Beach or a day-trip to Èze, Nice, Cannes or Menton.  \\n     • Hiking in the Maritime Alps just above town or cycling along the coast.  \\n     • Jazz Festival (July) or Grand Prix (May)—if you want excitement without casino pit stops.  \\n\\n5. Vibe & pace  \\n   • Macau: Compact—great if you like walking from temple to taco stall. Urban, slightly frenetic, but neighborhoods are small and walkable.  \\n   • Monaco: Small too, but steep hills, palm-lined boulevards and a very polished “jet-set” ambiance. More relaxed beach days, more day-trip options.  \\n\\n6. Budget-friendly ways to focus away from casinos  \\n   • Package a “theme” to your trip: culinary tour (cooking class + market visit), heritage walk with local guide, wellness retreat (spa or meditation class).  \\n   • Book accommodations well away from the casino zone—opt instead for a boutique guesthouse in Coloane (Macau) or a B&B in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin (Monaco area).  \\n   • Pre-schedule activities every day—museums, hikes, bike tours, cooking classes—so you aren’t tempted to drift back into a casino.  \\n   • Travel with a friend or group that shares your non-gambling goals.  \\n\\n7. A gentle nudge on the gambling issue  \\n   • If you’ve found yourself preoccupied with casinos at home, both Macau and Monaco are “big-league” gambling hubs. You might consider a destination less synonymous with betting—Thailand islands, Portugal’s Algarve, Costa Rica’s cloud forests or Japan’s cultural cities.  \\n   • If you do pick Macau or Monaco, look into self-exclusion programs before you go, or at least turn off casino marketing emails and app notifications. Set clear boundaries: “No casinos, no slot machines, no exceptions.”  \\n\\nBottom line:  \\n– Choose Macau if you’re drawn to its East-meets-West heritage, street-food scene and lower costs.  \\n– Choose Monaco if you crave Mediterranean sunshine, easy beach days, mountain hikes and that Riviera flair—at a premium.  \\n\\nWhichever you pick, anchor your trip with a non-gambling passion—food, history, hiking or coastal culture—and you’ll come home refreshed rather than falling back into old patterns. Enjoy exploring everything outside the casino doors!'"

       "'In its fresh, unaltered state granite is essentially impermeable and has virtually no pore space, so it cannot act as a conventional oil reservoir the way a sandstone or limestone can.

A few points to keep in mind:\\n\\n • Primary porosity vs. fracture porosity  \\n   – Primary porosity (the tiny gaps between grains/crystals) in granite is effectively zero.  \\n   – Fracture porosity (open cracks, joints, faults) can be significant if the rock is heavily fractured or brecciated.\\n\\n • Fractured-basement oil shows  \\n   – There are a handful of “basement” plays worldwide (East Java, parts of West Africa, offshore Canada) where oil or gas has been produced from fractured igneous or metamorphic rocks.  \\n   – Typically these are small, discontinuous accumulations controlled by fault zones or shear zones in the granite.\\n\\n • Weathered granite (“saprolite”)  \\n   – Near surface, granite can be chemically weathered into a loose, clay-rich saprolite that can have reasonable porosity.  \\n   – Very rarely, shallow oil shows have been reported in weathered basement, but commercial accumulations are virtually unknown.\\n\\n • Practical implications  \\n   – Even if fractures provide permeability, the total storage capacity is low (fracture porosities are usually <1\\u2009%), and it can be very hard to predict, drill, and exploit such traps.  \\n   – For these reasons the industry almost always looks first to sedimentary rocks (sandstones, carbonates, sometimes coals or shales) for reservoir targets.\\n\\nBottom line: granite itself is not a practical reservoir rock, but in a few exceptional cases heavily fractured or weathered granite has trapped hydrocarbons.'"

      "Catastrophe theory is a branch of applied mathematics—more specifically of bifurcation theory and singularity theory—that studies how small, smooth changes in the parameters of a system can cause sudden and dramatic (“catastrophic”) changes in its behavior or equilibrium states. It was pioneered in the 1960s by the French mathematician René Thom and further developed (and popularized) by E.C. Zeeman in applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Core idea  \n",
      "   • You have a system whose state x minimizes (or is a critical point of) some potential-like function V(x; α), where α = (α₁, α₂, …) are control parameters.  \n",
      "   • As you vary α slowly, the number or nature (stable vs. unstable) of equilibria (solutions of ∂V/∂x = 0) can change abruptly.  \n",
      "   • At certain critical parameter values, two or more equilibria coalesce or disappear in what is called a bifurcation or “catastrophe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Elementary catastrophes  \n",
      "   Under generic conditions (smooth functions, low-dimensional control space), Thom showed that there are only a handful of qualitatively distinct ways these sudden changes can occur.  In the case of up to four control parameters, the seven “elementary catastrophes” are:  \n",
      "   • Fold (1 control var.)  \n",
      "   • Cusp (2 control vars.)  \n",
      "   • Swallowtail (3 control vars.)  \n",
      "   • Butterfly (4 control vars.)  \n",
      "   • Elliptic umbilic (2 control vars, 2 state vars.)  \n",
      "   • Hyperbolic umbilic (2 control vars, 2 state vars.)  \n",
      "   • Parabolic umbilic (3 control vars, 2 state vars.)\n",
      "\n",
      "   Each has a simple “normal form” potential V(x; α) whose critical-point structure typifies that kind of sudden transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. A simple example: the cusp catastrophe  \n",
      "   Potential V(x; α, β) = x^4/4 + α x^2/2 + β x.  \n",
      "   • For certain (α, β) one finds one stable equilibrium; for others, three equilibria (two stable, one unstable).  \n",
      "   • The boundary between these regions is a cusp curve in the (α, β)-plane.  \n",
      "   • Crossing that boundary smoothly in parameter space causes a sudden jump in x.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Applications and limitations  \n",
      "   • Applications have been suggested in physics (phase transitions), biology (population crashes), ecology, economics (market crashes), psychology (decision-making “sudden shifts”), and more.  \n",
      "   • In practice, rigorous modeling requires verifying the existence of a potential function and checking genericity conditions.  Popular applications in the social sciences sometimes over-claim scope or fail to meet mathematical hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Mathematical framework  \n",
      "   • Singularity theory classifies critical points of families of functions under coordinate changes.  \n",
      "   • Thom’s theorem shows that, up to smooth coordinate changes in x and α, only finitely many “universal” singularities occur in low dimension.  \n",
      "   • One studies the “discriminant set” in parameter space—the locus of catastrophes—where the Jacobian and Hessian of V degenerate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, catastrophe theory provides a language and toolkit for understanding how continuous parameter drift can trigger discontinuous, qualitative shifts in system behavior.\n"

Stereotypes about leadership and assertiveness  \\n   •  The assumption: men are naturally more decisive, tough-minded or willing to “step on toes” in a high-pressure environment.  \\n   •  The effect: hiring managers believe men make stronger leaders, even when women have equal or stronger track records.\\n\\n3.  Belief that men are less “emotional” or easier to “manage”  \\n   •  The assumption: women are thought to be more prone to mood swings or interpersonal drama.  \\n   •  The effect: people claim men will fit in more smoothly with existing teams and avoid morale-undermining conflicts.\\n\\nNote: All three rationales are based on stereotype rather than evidence.

However, **I can't provide the exact text of the first paragraph as it is copyrighted material.** If you have a copy of the book, you can easily find this in the opening pages. Alternatively, I can help summarize the book or discuss its themes, characters, and more. Let me know how else I may assist you!\n"
