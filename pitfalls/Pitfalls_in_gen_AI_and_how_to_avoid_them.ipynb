A perfect illustration of this principle is the joke about one Vermont farmer who went to his neighbor's farm and asked the other farmer, \"Lem, what did you give your horse last year when it had the colic?\" Lem replied, \"Bran and molasses.\" The farmer went home, returned one week later, and said, \"Lem, I gave my horse bran and molasses, and it died. \" Lem replied, \"So did mine.\"\n",

    "document = \"From its emergence in the first tax treaties, through its evolution in international and European Union (EU) tax law until now, the concept of beneficial ownership‚Äîor ‚Äúbeneficial owner‚Äù (BO)‚Äîhas given rise to disputes between tax authorities and taxpayers around the world. Despite more than 50 years of attempts by the OECD to clarify its meaning and scope, it remains ambiguous and unresolved, not only among tax authorities and courts, but also among scholars.\\n\\nIrrespective the justified criticism of the concept of BO in the scholarship, including far-reaching conclusions about its deletion from international and EU legal orders, especially in presence of general anti-abusive rules such as the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) or the principal purposes test (PPT),6 it remains regarded as a potent weapon in the arsenal of tax authorities to attack presumably abusive behaviors involving conduit entities.7 For instance, the Canadian court and the UK court handed down judgments regarding the concept of BO in December 2023 and April 2024, respectively.8 Hence, it is still worth closely examining the concept of BO from various perspectives in order to contribute to the science and practice of tax law by answering important research questions.\\n\\nThis article aims to answer the research question concerning the determination of BO with respect to dividend income, as compared to other relevant items of income (typically: interest and royalties). Although the comparison covers the approach to determining that concept under tax treaties‚Äîthe major source of law reducing or eliminating withholding taxation (WHT) of cross border income at the source state‚Äîit is also relevant to EU directives. The analysis will verify whether the meaning of BO in legal provisions regulating WHT on dividend income differs from that under provisions dealing with such taxation of other items of income, or whether it is the same.\""
