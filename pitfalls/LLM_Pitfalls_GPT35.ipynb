The theory uses mathematical models called \"catastrophe models\" to describe these sudden transitions and predict the conditions under which they are likely to occur.\\n\\nCatastrophe theory has been used to explain a variety of phenomena, such as sudden changes in animal behavior, the collapse of structures under stress, and sudden shifts in economic markets. It has also been used to study the behavior of complex systems, such as the weather and the stock market, and to develop strategies for managing and controlling these systems.'"
