Of course, it would be entirely possible to write a suite of tests that will all fail for this model too, or a suite which would all pass.

Concealment**\\n- Hiding items in bags, purses, backpacks, clothing, or strollers.\\n- Wearing oversized clothing or jackets to hide merchandise.\\n- Using shopping bags from other stores to conceal items.\\n\\n**2. Distraction**\\n- Working in groups: one or more distract staff with questions, while an accomplice steals.\\n- Creating distractions (e.g., asking for help at the far end of the shop).\\n\\n**3. Packaging Tricks**\\n- Swapping price tags or barcodes to pay less, or buying one item and hiding others in its packaging.\\n- Removing items from packaging.\\n\\n**4. Quick Grab-and-Go**\\n- Grabbing items near the door and running out (“snatch and dash”).\\n\\n**5. Switching Containers**\\n- Placing expensive items inside lower-priced boxes or containers.\\n\\n**6. Fake Returns or Exchanges**\\n- Bringing in “returned” stolen merchandise for store credit or cash.\\n\\n### Behavioral Signs to Watch For\\n\\n- **Nervous or Shifty Behavior:** Avoiding eye contact, looking around frequently, appearing anxious, or frequently watching staff.\\n- **Lingering:** Spending excessive time in one area, especially near small, high-value items.\\n- **Repeatedly Picking Up and Putting Down Items:** Handling merchandise without a clear intent to buy.\\n- **Groups:** Large or distracting groups, especially if some members hang back unsupervised.\\n- **Unusually Bulky Clothing Out of Season:** Coats, scarves, or bags on hot days can be a red flag.\\n- **Entering with Big Bags or Strollers:** These can be used to conceal merchandise.\\n\\n### Additional Prevention Tips\\n\\n- **Keep Displays Organized:** Messy shelves make it easier for theft to go unnoticed.\\n- **Limit Access to High-Value Items:** Place valuable or small items behind the counter or in locked cases.\\n- **Train Staff:** Ensure all staff greet customers and remain attentive.\\n- **Install Mirrors and Cameras:** Use mirrors in blind spots and visible security cameras as deterrents.\\n- **Check Bags When Suspected:** If your store policy and local law allow, ask to check bags when you suspect theft.\\n\\n**Remember:** Never jeopardize your safety—if you suspect someone is about to shoplift, it’s often best to approach them and offer help, which signals you’ve noticed them, or contact security/law enforcement if you feel threatened.\\n\\n**Good customer service is often the best deterrent. A friendly, watchful staff can discourage most shoplifters!**'"

This means the wavelet is **symmetric** about \\\\( t = 0 \\\\).\\n\\n3. **Zero-Phase Condition:**  \\n   - A function that is symmetric in time (even function) will have **zero phase** in the frequency domain.\\n   - In Fourier analysis, a zero-phase signal means the phase spectrum is zero everywhere (or strictly 0 or π, for negative frequencies, due to spectrum symmetry).\\n\\n4. **Physical Interpretation:**  \\n   - Zero phase means all frequency components are aligned—there is no time shift in any sinusoidal component.\\n   - The wavelet’s energy is **centered at zero time**.\\n\\n### Summary Table\\n\\n| Wavelet property     | Mathematical characteristic      | Phase type    |\\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|\\n| Symmetric (even)     | \\\\( w(-t) = w(t) \\\\)              | Zero phase    |\\n| Antisymmetric (odd)  | \\\\( w(-t) = -w(t) \\\\)             | 90° phase     |\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- Sheriff, R.

       "\"It’s great that you’re looking to take a break from gambling—vacations can be a wonderful reset! Given what you shared, **Macau** and **Monaco** are both dazzling destinations, but they’re also famously centered around casinos and luxury gaming. If your goal is truly to take your mind off gambling and show your wife you’re serious about a change, these locations might make it difficult, as their main attractions are tied to the very activity you’re trying to avoid.\\n\\n**A quick comparison:**\\n\\n- **Macau:** Known as the “Las Vegas of Asia.” The city’s main attractions are its massive casino resorts. There is *rich culture and beautiful architecture* (think Portuguese heritage sites), but gambling is everywhere.\\n- **Monaco:** Famous for the Monte Carlo Casino and luxury lifestyle. While it's also beautiful (Mediterranean coastlines, gardens, Formula 1), the wealth and casino culture are front and center.\\n\\n**Suggestions:**\\n- If you still prefer these places, perhaps you can prioritize **non-gambling activities** like exploring cultural sites, trying new cuisines, or enjoying natural attractions.\\n- Alternatively, consider another destination *not centered around gambling or casinos*—somewhere with lots of outdoor activities, cultural experiences, or relaxation, to better support your goal of stepping away from addiction. Destinations like Japan, New Zealand, Italy, or Costa Rica provide world-class experiences without the casino focus.\\n\\n**If you really want a healthy reset:**  \\nHaving an honest conversation with your wife and discussing what you both hope to get from this vacation can help a lot. Maybe focus on places that support new memories and healthy, shared interests. If you do pick Macau or Monaco, plan your days in advance to avoid casino environments.\\n\\nWould you like a few suggestions for travel spots with little-to-no gambling focus?

       "'You’re on a good track! Here’s some context and advice:\\n\\n**Klauder wavelet overview:**\\n- A Klauder wavelet (often called a “Klauder waveform” or “Klauder wavelet sweep”) is a swept-frequency wavelet designed to have good correlation properties and broad bandwidth.\\n- In seismic, it’s often associated with synthetic modeling and deconvolution research, less so with direct field acquisition.\\n\\n**For your 3D synthetic seismic modeling:**\\n- The **Klauder wavelet** is built by autocorrelating a linear sweep (chirp) signal; it’s zero phase and typically has very compact temporal support.\\n- It is ideal if you want a controlled, large-bandwidth wavelet, and when you need to know the exact phase and frequency content.\\n\\n**Pros for your use-case:**\\n- **Broad and controlled bandwidth**—you define the sweep limits as needed for your field’s velocities and anticipated frequency content.\\n- **Zero-phase**—seismic reflectivity series are convolved with symmetric, non-causal Klauder wavelets in most synthetic modeling, which facilitates interpretation.\\n- **Easy to generate in Python**—it’s straightforward to create a sweep and then autocorrelate.\\n\\n**Potential considerations:**\\n- **Real-data mismatch**—real field seismic sources (like air-guns in the North Sea) produce wavelets that may differ (minimum phase, not perfectly broad bandwidth, affected by ghosting, etc). If you want your synthetics to look *just* like field data, you might use statistical wavelets, extracted from field data, or minimum-phase Ricker.\\n- **Interpretation consistency**—be explicit in your reports/presentations that your synthetics use a Klauder wavelet, so interpreters know how your modeling relates to actual seismic.\\n\\n**Typical alternatives:**\\n- **Ricker wavelet:** Good default choice, band-limited, zero-phase; commonly used for straightforward synthetic seismic in literature and software.\\n- **Extracted wavelet:** For best match to a particular field example.\\n- **Or, use the theoretical source signature of your acquisition system, if you have it.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary/advice:**  \\nA Klauder wavelet is a good, reasonable choice for forward modeling in seismic, especially if you want great time/frequency control and zero-phase response. Just be aware of the differences from field data and communicate your wavelet choices. If you want quick code, let me know!\\n\\n**Let me know if you want Python code to generate one!**'"

      "5. Each triad gets a unique 7 or 6 digit code.\n",
      "6. But since the mapping for \"CIV\" and \"CIL\" is not given, we can't write the exact digits.\n",
      "7. But **if we had the code for \"CIV\"** (say \"abcdefg\") and code for \"CIL\" (say \"hijklm\"), **the code would be \"abcdefghijklm\" (13 digits).**\n",
      "\n",
      "**So the answer is:**\n",
      "> If MIX is 1000110 and MIMIC is 1000110001100, then the code for CIVIL is the 13-digit string consisting of the code for CIV (unknown), followed by the code for CIL (unknown).\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Developed by**: French mathematician René Thom in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n",

      "\n",
      "### **Basic Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **States and Control Parameters**: A system's \"state\" describes its current condition; various control parameters influence this state (e.g., temperature, pressure, stress).\n",
      "- **Catastrophe**: A sudden, dramatic change in the outcome or state, even though the parameter changes are smooth and gradual.\n",
      "- **Cusp Catastrophe**: The simplest and most famous type, often illustrated by a surface with a characteristic cusp shape, showing that for some parameter ranges, the system can jump between two or more states.\n",

      "### **Applications**\n",
      "\n",
      "Catastrophe theory has been used to explore:\n",
      "- Phase transitions in physics (water turning to ice)\n",
      "- Buckling of structures in engineering\n",
      "- Economic market crashes\n",
      "- Biological morphogenesis (the development of shapes)\n",
      "- Sudden mood changes in psychology\n",

      "### **Common Catastrophes**\n",

Alternative products (such as plant-based and synthetic oils) had replaced whale oil in most industrial applications, making the business economically unattractive.\\n\\n3. **New Regulatory Restrictions:** The International Whaling Commission (IWC) and other regulatory bodies were moving towards a moratorium on commercial whaling.

    "\n",
    "> In \"Lord of the Flies\" by William Golding, the story begins with the aftermath of a plane crash, where a group of boys are stranded on an uninhabited island. The first paragraph introduces the setting and the situation, focusing on the scar left by the crashed plane in the jungle. However, **I can't provide the exact text of the first paragraph as it is copyrighted material.** If you have a copy of the book, you can easily find this in the opening pages. Alternatively, I can help summarize the book or discuss its themes, characters, and more. Let me know how else I may assist you!\n"
