Visible, friendly service is a powerful deterrent.\\n- Keep the store tidy and maintain clear sightlines; use mirrors and good lighting.\\n- Place small, high-value items near the counter or in locked/attended cases. Limit quantities per facing.\\n- Use EAS/RFID tags and keep pedestals working; post polite signage about security.\\n- Fitting rooms: limit item counts, hand out numbered tags, and track items in/out.\\n- Offer help as an intercept: “Can I start a fitting room for you?” “Let me hold those at the counter.” “Would you like a basket?” This puts staff presence near the items.\\n- Train cashiers to slow down transactions, count back change audibly, and follow a standard script to defeat quick-change scams.\\n- Tighten return policies: require receipts or ID for high-value returns, refund to original tender, set time limits, and log returns.\\n- Schedule extra coverage during peak hours; assign zone ownership so every area is “owned” by someone.\\n- Do regular shelf counts on hot items; fix empty hooks quickly and investigate empty packaging.\\n- Keep an incident log and share patterns with neighboring businesses; build a relationship with local police/ORC task forces.\\n- Apply policies consistently and focus on behavior, not appearance, to avoid profiling.\\n\\nIf you suspect shoplifting\\n- Prioritize safety. Do not chase or physically confront. Follow your store’s policy and local laws (shopkeeper’s privilege varies by jurisdiction).\\n- Use customer-service approaches first: stay nearby, offer assistance, and make eye contact.\\n- If your policy allows, ask a calm, non-accusatory question at the threshold: “Would you like to pay for that item?” only if you clearly saw concealment and uninterrupted possession.\\n- Note details (person description, companions, vehicle, direction of travel) and save camera footage. File a report if appropriate.\\n- After an alarm sounds, handle politely: “May I rescan that item?” Many alarms are accidental.\\n\\nIf you’d like, tell me your store layout and top items at risk, and I can suggest targeted, low-cost changes.'"

It is called “zero phase” only when a symmetrized version is used.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- Classical Berlage pulse: w(t) = H(t) t^n e^(−α t) cos(2π f0 t + φ). This is one‑sided (causal) and asymmetric, so its spectrum has nonzero phase; it is typically minimum phase.\\n- “Zero‑phase Berlage” used in some software/texts is constructed by making the waveform even in time, e.g., w_z(t) = |t|^n e^(−α |t|) cos(2π f0 t) (or by taking the Berlage amplitude spectrum and setting phase to zero). A real, even time function has a purely real spectrum, i.e., zero phase (up to 0/π).\\n\\nSo, if someone says “the Berlage wavelet is zero phase,” they are referring to this even, noncausal variant by construction—not the original causal Berlage pulse.'"

For marine modeling you’ll usually get more realistic results with a band-limited Ormsby (zero-phase or minimum-phase) or, best of all, a wavelet estimated from nearby seismic.\\n\\nWhat to choose, by purpose:\\n- Algorithm tests or generic band-limited modeling: Ricker (simple) or Ormsby (tunable band).\\n- Marine realism: Ormsby with source/receiver ghosts and optional Q attenuation; optionally convert to minimum phase.\\n- If you still want Klauder: use it as a zero-phase, band-limited wavelet with sweep band close to your survey bandwidth.\\n\\nTypical North Sea bands (adjust to your data):\\n- Legacy streamer: ~5–10–60–80 Hz (Ormsby corners f1–f2–f3–f4).\\n- Modern broadband: ~3–6–80–100 Hz.\\n- If using Klauder: sweep ~5–80 Hz.\\n- Note marine ghosts: with source/receiver tow depths ~6–8 m, ghost notches near ~100–130 Hz; if you include ghosts, you’ll naturally suppress energy near these notches.\\n\\nPython snippets\\n\\n1) Klauder wavelet (from a linear sweep autocorrelation)\\n- Good zero-phase, band-limited wavelet. Use a taper on the sweep to reduce sidelobes.\\n\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom scipy.signal import chirp, tukey, correlate\\n\\ndef klauder_wavelet(f1, f2, T, dt, taper=0.1, outlen=None):\\n    # Build linear sweep\\n    t = np.arange(0, T, dt)\\n    s = chirp(t, f0=f1, f1=f2, t1=T, method='linear', phi=0)\\n    s *= tukey(len(s), taper)\\n    # Autocorrelation (Klauder)\\n    ac = correlate(s, s, mode='full')\\n    ac /= np.max(np.abs(ac))\\n    # Centered time axis\\n    tac = np.arange(-len(s)+1, len(s)) * dt\\n    # Window to a practical wavelet length\\n    if outlen is None:\\n        outlen = 0.256  # seconds, adjust as needed\\n    mask = np.abs(tac) <= outlen/2\\n    w = ac[mask]\\n    tw = tac[mask]\\n    return w, tw\\n\\n# Example\\ndt = 0.002\\nw, tw = klauder_wavelet(f1=5, f2=80, T=8.0, dt=dt, taper=0.1, outlen=0.256)\\n\\n2) Ormsby wavelet (zero-phase)\\n- Very common for marine; you pick four corner frequencies.\\n\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef ormsby_wavelet(f1, f2, f3, f4, dt, outlen):\\n    n = int(np.round(outlen/dt))\\n    n = n + (n % 2)  # make even\\n    # Frequency axis (one-sided)\\n    freqs = np.fft.rfftfreq(n, d=dt)\\n    A = np.zeros_like(freqs)\\n    # Piecewise-linear (trapezoid) amplitude\\n    def ramp(x, x0, x1):  # 0->1 from x0 to x1\\n        return np.clip((x - x0) / max(x1 - x0, 1e-12), 0, 1)\\n    A += ramp(freqs, f1, f2)\\n    A -= ramp(freqs, f3, f4)\\n    A = np.clip(A, 0, None)\\n    # Zero-phase spectrum: real, even\\n    Wpos = A.astype(np.complex128)  # zero phase\\n    w = np.fft.irfft(Wpos, n=n)\\n    # Center at t=0\\n    w = np.fft.fftshift(w)\\n    t = (np.arange(n) - n//2) * dt\\n    # Normalize\\n    w /= np.max(np.abs(w))\\n    return w, t\\n\\n# Example (broadband marine)\\nw, t = ormsby_wavelet(3, 6, 80, 100, dt=0.002, outlen=0.256)\\n\\n3) Optional: apply marine ghosts (source and receiver)\\n- Multiplies the wavelet spectrum by the ghost operators; set depths in meters.\\n\\ndef apply_ghosts(w, dt, d_src, d_rcv, c=1500.0):\\n    n = len(w)\\n    W = np.fft.rfft(np.fft.ifftshift(w))\\n    f = np.fft.rfftfreq(n, d=dt)\\n    Gs = 1.0 - np.exp(1j * 2*np.pi * f * 2*d_src/c)\\n    Gr = 1.0 - np.exp(1j * 2*np.pi * f * 2*d_rcv/c)\\n    Wg = W * Gs * Gr\\n    wg = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.irfft(Wg, n=n))\\n    wg /= np.max(np.abs(wg))\\n    return wg\\n\\n# Example\\nwg = apply_ghosts(w, dt=0.002, d_src=7.0, d_rcv=6.0)\\n\\n4) Convolution with reflectivity\\n\\ndef reflectivity_to_trace(r, w):\\n    # Centered convolution\\n    return np.convolve(r, w, mode='same')\\n\\nGuidance on parameters\\n- Pick the band from nearby shot records or processed spectra if you can. If not, start with 3–6–80–100 Hz (Ormsby) or a 5–80 Hz Klauder, dt=2 ms, wavelet length 200–300 ms.\\n- If you need minimum phase, convert the Ormsby amplitude to minimum phase (via Hilbert transform of log-amplitude) or apply a time-variant Q after convolution to introduce realistic phase and attenuation.\\n- Include ghosts if you want acquisition realism; omit them if you’re benchmarking inversion or interpretation.\\n\\nIf you share your sampling (dt), intended bandwidth, and whether you want zero- or minimum-phase (and whether you want ghosts/Q), I can tailor the wavelet and provide a ready-to-run snippet for your exact case.\""

Both Macau and Monaco can be enjoyed without setting foot in a casino, but they’re also packed with triggers. If your main goal is to take your mind off gambling, I’ll show you how each place can work, plus a few ways to avoid temptation.\\n\\nQuick comparison\\n- Overall vibe:\\n  - Macau: East-meets-West heritage, temples and Portuguese architecture, street food, neon.\\n  - Monaco: Riviera glam, yachts, museums and gardens, easy day trips along the French coast.\\n- Cost:\\n  - Macau: generally mid-range (food and hotels noticeably cheaper).\\n  - Monaco: very expensive (lodging and meals can add up fast).\\n- Best weather:\\n  - Macau: October–December (drier, pleasant). Summers are hot/humid with storms.\\n  - Monaco: May–June or September (warm, fewer crowds). July–August is hot/crowded/pricey.\\n- Language/ease:\\n  - Macau: Cantonese/Portuguese; English common in tourism.\\n  - Monaco: French/Italian; English widely understood.\\n- Visas:\\n  - Macau: many nationalities get visa-free short stays.\\n  - Monaco: follows Schengen rules (you may need a Schengen visa depending on passport).\\n- Getting around:\\n  - Macau: compact; buses/LRT; ferries to Hong Kong; avoid casino shuttles if triggering.\\n  - Monaco: very walkable; buses; frequent trains to Nice, Menton, Èze, Cannes.\\n\\nHow to do each destination with minimal casino exposure\\n\\nMacau (3–4 days, casino-free focus)\\n- Base: Taipa Village or Coloane (quieter, fewer casinos nearby than Cotai Strip).\\n- Day 1: Historic Centre (Ruins of St. Paul’s, Monte Fort, Senado Square, St. Dominic’s, A-Ma Temple), Macao Museum, Portuguese-Macanese cuisine.\\n- Day 2: Taipa Village alleys, food crawl (pork chop buns, egg tarts), Taipa Houses-Museum, evening views from Penha Hill or Guia Lighthouse.\\n- Day 3: Coloane hiking trails, Hac Sa or Cheoc Van beach, Giant Panda Pavilion, dinner at a Coloane seafood spot.\\n- Extras: Macau Tower observation deck (great sunset), art spaces, heritage walks.\\n- Avoid: Cotai mega-resorts and their free shuttles; book smaller hotels with no gaming floor.\\n\\nMonaco (3–4 days, casino-free focus)\\n- Base: Fontvieille or Larvotto/Beach area; hotels without casinos like Columbus Monte‑Carlo or Novotel Monte‑Carlo.\\n- Day 1: Old Town/Le Rocher (Prince’s Palace, Cathedral), Oceanographic Museum, Exotic Garden, Princess Grace Rose Garden.\\n- Day 2: Larvotto Beach, Japanese Garden, coastal path to Cap d’Ail or Saint‑Jean‑Cap‑Ferrat, sunset harbor walk.\\n- Day 3: Easy day trips by train—Èze (medieval village + Nietzsche Path), Menton (gardens, pastel old town), Nice (promenade, markets), or Villefranche.\\n- Extras: Car collection museum, coastal e‑bike rides, spa day.\\n- Avoid: Place du Casino area in the evenings; choose routes that skirt Casino Square.\\n\\nWhich is better for you?\\n- Pick Macau if:\\n  - You want rich cultural contrast and fantastic (affordable) food.\\n  - You’re okay navigating a city where casino resorts are widespread but avoidable if you base in Taipa/Coloane.\\n  - You’re traveling in Oct–Dec and want comfortable weather at a lower cost.\\n\\n- Pick Monaco if:\\n  - You want seaside scenery and easy non-gambling day trips along the Riviera.\\n  - You prefer a place where casinos are concentrated in one zone you can avoid.\\n  - Your budget can handle high hotel/meal prices, ideally in May–June or September.\\n\\nTrigger-minimizing tips (whichever you choose)\\n- Pick a hotel with no gaming floor and away from casino districts (Cotai Strip in Macau; Place du Casino in Monaco).\\n- Plan full days with specific, non-gambling activities so you’re not “wandering.”\\n- Don’t use casino-branded shuttles; stick to public transit or taxis.\\n- Set up app/site blockers and card limits before you go; travel with a companion if possible.\\n- If useful, enroll in local self-exclusion: Macau and Monaco both allow you to request refusal of entry to casinos.\\n\\nIf you’re open to alternatives with fewer gambling cues:\\n- Coastal nature and food: San Sebastián, the Amalfi Coast, Madeira, Azores.\\n- Culture-forward cities: Kyoto, Lisbon, Seville.\\n- Nature reset: Iceland, the Dolomites, New Zealand’s South Island, Costa Rica.\\n\\nWould you like me to build a detailed 3–4 day, casino-free itinerary for one of these (including specific hotels and restaurants)?

       "'Short answer: yes—but only when it’s fractured and/or weathered.\\n\\nKey points\\n- Granite’s matrix is extremely tight (porosity typically <1%, permeability near zero), so it can’t store or transmit oil on its own.\\n- Oil can accumulate and flow in granite where there is:\\n  - A dense, connected network of natural fractures and faults.\\n  - A weathered “basement top” (saprolite) that adds secondary porosity.\\n  - An effective seal above (e.g., shales/evaporites) and a nearby sedimentary source rock feeding hydrocarbons along faults.\\n- Such “basement reservoirs” are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic. Productivity depends on fracture density, connectivity, aperture, and present-day stress. They often require careful horizontal placement guided by seismic and image logs; water breakthrough and rapid declines are common risks.\\n\\nExamples\\n- Bach Ho (White Tiger) and Rong fields, Cuu Long Basin, offshore Vietnam (fractured granitic basement).\\n- Zeit Bay, Gulf of Suez, Egypt.\\n- Several Yemen fields (e.g., Habban/Kharir) producing from fractured Precambrian basement.\\n\\nNote\\n- This does not imply oil originates in granite; the source is almost always adjacent sedimentary rocks. Granite here acts only as a fractured/weathered reservoir.\\n- “Granite wash” plays are different—they’re clastic sediments derived from granite, not the granite itself.'"

      "- Attach the supporting analysis. If the bank has a standard (e.g., SPE PRMS chance of success), align to that and/or get a third‑party geologist/reserves auditor to opine.\n",

      "Practical next steps\n",
      "- Pin down validated Sensitivity and Specificity for your detector (blind trials, sample size, confidence intervals).\n",

      "  - Historical exploration/development success rates in the same formation/basin\n",

It classifies the generic ways equilibria of a system appear, disappear, or switch stability as control parameters change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key ideas:\n",
      "- State vs. control variables: A system has state (behavior) variables that settle at equilibria and control parameters that you tune externally.\n",
      "- Potential/energy landscape: Many models use a smooth potential V(x; parameters). Equilibria are minima of V. As parameters change, minima can merge or vanish, causing sudden jumps.\n",
      "- Catastrophe (bifurcation) set: Curves or surfaces in parameter space across which the number or stability of equilibria changes.\n",
      "- Elementary catastrophes: Thom showed that, for low-dimensional cases, there are a few generic types (fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, and three umbilics). These are the “normal forms” of abrupt change.\n",
      "- Classic example (cusp catastrophe, one state variable x, two controls a, b):\n",
      "  V(x) = x^4/4 + (a/2) x^2 + b x\n",
      "  As (a, b) vary, the system can jump between two stable states and exhibit hysteresis.\n",
      "- Applications: Mechanical snap-through (buckling), phase transitions, optics (caustics), population collapses, market switches, traffic and crowd dynamics—any setting with tipping points and hysteresis.\n",
      "- What it’s for: Classifying and visualizing how abrupt transitions can arise generically; predicting where tipping sets lie in parameter space; explaining hysteresis loops.\n",
      "- Limits and cautions: Works best for gradient-like systems with smooth potentials; early overclaims led to criticism. Today it’s integrated into modern bifurcation theory and used where its assumptions fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, catastrophe theory gives a language and toolkit to understand when and how small parameter changes can trigger big, sudden shifts in a system’s state.\n"

A cross-functional review team—comprising IT security, architecture, compliance, and business stakeholders—assesses the proposal for alignment with enterprise standards on data classification, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

As part of the qualification process, teams shall systematically consider open source alternatives before committing to a commercial solution. This evaluation covers code quality, license compatibility, and the health of the upstream community—factors including frequency of updates, vulnerability disclosures, and breadth of contributions.

       "'Here’s a practical way to approach a DEI policy that is credible, actionable, and sustainable.\\n\\nStart with the groundwork\\n- Align to business strategy: Clarify why DEI matters to your mission, customers, innovation, talent, and risk management.\\n- Map your legal context: Identify applicable laws where you operate (e.g., EEOC/Title VII in the U.S., Equality Act 2010 in the UK, GDPR for data privacy, local accommodation and pay equity laws). Get legal review early.\\n- Baseline data and risks: Analyze workforce composition, pay equity, hiring funnels, promotions, attrition, engagement survey results, and complaint themes. Identify hotspots and root causes.\\n- Co-create with stakeholders: Involve employees, ERG leaders, managers, HR, legal, facilities/IT, and exec sponsors. Include perspectives across levels, locations, and identities.\\n- Decide scope: Global policy with local addenda, or separate regional policies. Name who is covered (employees, contractors, interns, applicants, vendors on-site).\\n\\nHow to structure the policy\\n- Purpose and scope: One paragraph on intent; specify who it covers and where it applies.\\n- Definitions: Concise glossary for diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, accessibility, harassment, discrimination, bullying, protected characteristics, reasonable accommodations, pronouns, gender identity.\\n- Commitment statement: Clear, values-based commitment that goes beyond compliance without promising quotas or unlawful preferences.\\n- Roles and accountability:\\n  - Board/Executives: Set goals, allocate budget, review progress.\\n  - Leaders/Managers: Create inclusive teams, complete training, use fair processes.\\n  - HR/DEI: Enable data, training, policies, investigations, audits.\\n  - Employees: Uphold code of conduct, report concerns, complete training.\\n  - Vendors: Adhere to standards; include in contracts where appropriate.\\n- Inclusive workplace standards:\\n  - Anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, anti-bullying; examples of prohibited conduct; bystander expectations.\\n  - Psychological safety and respectful communication (meetings, chat tools, pronoun use).\\n  - Reasonable accommodations process (disability, pregnancy, religion, caregiving); how to request; timelines; confidentiality.\\n  - Accessibility standards (physical and digital; commit to WCAG 2.1 AA for digital tools; event accessibility).\\n  - Flexible work and inclusive scheduling (time zones, caregiving, religious observances).\\n  - Facilities and benefits (inclusive restrooms, gender-affirming and reproductive care where lawful, domestic partner benefits).\\n- Fair talent practices:\\n  - Hiring: Inclusive job descriptions, structured interviews, consistent rubrics, trained panels, accommodations for candidates, bias checks on assessments/AI tools, diverse sourcing, fair background checks.\\n  - Development: Transparent career paths, equitable access to high-visibility work, sponsorship/mentorship, learning budgets.\\n  - Performance and promotion: Calibrations, evidence-based criteria, documentation, second-review for equity.\\n  - Pay equity: Regular audits with remediation; publish methodology; govern starting pay and adjustments.\\n- Reporting and investigations:\\n  - Multiple safe channels (anonymous hotline, HR, manager, DEI inbox).\\n  - Anti-retaliation pledge and examples.\\n  - Investigation standards: intake within X business days; impartial investigator; confidentiality to the extent possible; documented findings; remedies; communication of closure.\\n  - Escalation options and appeal.\\n- Data, privacy, and measurement:\\n  - Voluntary self-identification; what’s collected and why; consent; storage; who sees what; retention and deletion.\\n  - Regular reporting cadence and transparency level (e.g., annual DEI report).\\n  - Safeguards for small populations to prevent re-identification.\\n- ERGs and communities:\\n  - Purpose, charter template, executive sponsors, funding, event approval, data privacy, open membership, guardrails for political activity.\\n- Supplier and community engagement:\\n  - Supplier diversity expectations; tracking and goals; accessibility requirements in procurement.\\n  - Community partnerships and volunteering guidelines.\\n- Governance:\\n  - DEI council composition, meeting cadence, decision rights.\\n  - Policy review cycle (e.g., annual).\\n  - Audit and risk management (link to internal audit, ISO 30415 or equivalent frameworks if relevant).\\n\\nKeep it measurable without creating unlawful quotas\\n- Use goal types:\\n  - Leading indicators: % of managers trained, % roles with structured interviews, % accommodations fulfilled within SLA, accessibility conformance rates, ERG participation.\\n  - Lagging indicators: Representation by level and function, hiring/promotion rates by group, pay equity gaps, attrition gaps, inclusion survey items (e.g., belonging, fairness, voice).\\n- Target setting tips:\\n  - Aim for improvements in processes and outcomes without setting set-asides or preferential treatment.\\n  - Example: “Increase structured interviews coverage from 40% to 95% by Q4” rather than “Hire X people of Y identity.”\\n- Tie leadership performance and incentives to process and outcome goals.\\n\\nSample language you can adapt\\n- Commitment: “We are committed to a workplace where all people can belong and thrive. We prohibit discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We design our systems to be fair, we remove barriers to opportunity, and we hold ourselves accountable through measurement and transparent reporting.”\\n- Anti-retaliation: “Retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, raises a concern or participates in an investigation is prohibited and will result in corrective action.”\\n- Accommodations: “We will provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities, for sincerely held religious beliefs and practices, and for pregnancy-related needs unless doing so would cause undue hardship. To request an accommodation, contact [email/contact method]. We will respond within [X] business days.”\\n- Data privacy: “Self-identification is voluntary. We use DEI data in aggregate to measure and improve equity. Individual data is restricted, kept confidential, and handled under our privacy policy and applicable laws.”\\n\\nImplementation roadmap (example)\\n- Weeks 1–4: Discovery, legal review, draft policy and glossary, design reporting channels, pick metrics and dashboards, plan training.\\n- Weeks 5–8: Stakeholder review, pilot procedures (hiring, investigations, accommodations), update templates and ATS/HRIS fields for self-ID and accessibility, prep comms.\\n- Weeks 9–12: Launch policy; manager and investigator training; publish metrics baseline; open ERG applications; set up supplier diversity requirements.\\n- Ongoing: Quarterly metric reviews; annual pay equity audit and DEI report; annual policy refresh; accessibility audits; independent review every 2–3 years.\\n\\nCommon pitfalls to avoid\\n- Aspirational statements without resourcing or authority.\\n- One-off training without process change.\\n- Unclear reporting and investigation steps.\\n- Setting quotas or making employment decisions based on protected traits.\\n- Collecting sensitive data without clear purpose, consent, or safeguards.\\n- Global policy that ignores local legal and cultural realities.\\n- Over-indexing on events while neglecting structural barriers.\\n\\nRight-size for your organization\\n- Small orgs: Focus on essentials—clear conduct standards, reporting, accommodations, structured hiring, basic metrics, and a lightweight DEI council.\\n- Larger orgs: Add formal audits, supplier diversity, ERG governance, comprehensive accessibility program, manager capability building, published annual DEI reports.\\n\\nStandards and references to consider\\n- ISO 30415 (Human resource management—Diversity and inclusion)\\n- W3C WCAG 2.1 AA (digital accessibility)\\n- EEOC harassment and EEO guidance; EEO-1 reporting (US)\\n- UK Equality Act 2010; Gender Pay Gap reporting (UK)\\n- Your data privacy regime (e.g., GDPR/CCPA)\\n\\nIf helpful, I can turn this into a tailored, one-page policy and a companion playbook based on your country, industry, and headcount.'"

      "- Alkaline noodles (chewy): Add 1/2–1 tsp baking soda per cup flour, plus salt and water; knead, rest, cut or pull into noodles, boil, then toss with oil and salt.\n",
      "- Water crêpes: Thin batter (about 1 cup water to 1 cup flour), pinch salt, a little oil; swirl in a nonstick pan for thin wraps.\n",
      "- Drop dumplings: Thick, sticky dough; spoon small blobs into salted boiling water until they float; drain, toss with oil, pan-sear if you like.\n",
      "- Fry bread: Soft dough, rest, pat into disks, shallow-fry in oil until puffed and golden; sprinkle with salt.\n",
