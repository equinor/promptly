They are presented here with some tweaking and augmentation, in order to try to get them to fail for Claude as well. However, I did not pursue this failure relentlessly. Of course, it would be entirely possible to write a suite of tests that will all fail for this model too, or a suite which would all pass. But I think I am comfortable saying that Claude performs better than ChatGPT 3.5 on the specific tasks I have outlined here, with a roughly 30% reduction in error. This is abot the same performance as ChatGPT 4 Turbo (see separate notebook)."
