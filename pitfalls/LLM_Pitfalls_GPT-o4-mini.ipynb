Of course, it would be entirely possible to write a suite of tests that will all fail for this model too, or a suite which would all pass.

Establish circulation  \\n   • Pick one of the standard methods (e.g. Driller’s Method or Wait-and-Weight Method).  \\n   • For Driller’s Method:  \\n     – Circulate out influx with original mud at controlled rates, slowly increasing mud weight in the pits in stages.  \\n     – Continue until kill weight mud is fully in the hole.  \\n   • For Wait-and-Weight:  \\n     – Bullhead kill original influx, then circulate full‐bore with kill mud in one continuous operation.\\n\\n4. Monitor pressures and rates  \\n   • Keep ECD ≤ fracture gradient.  \\n   • Maintain constant pump pressure once kill mud reaches bottom (bracket pressure ± 300 psi).\\n\\n5. End kill and return to drilling  \\n   • Once influx is circulated out and static pressures stabilize, open chokes slowly.  \\n   • Verify no further gas returns.  \\n   • Resume drilling or tripping per normal procedures.\\n\\nKey reminders:  \\n• Always verify kill calculations with the latest well data.  \\n• Communicate pressures and volumes continuously with the driller and mud engineer.  \\n• Use the company’s well‐control manual and approved kill sheets.'"

       "'Here are some of the most common shoplifting methods and the warning signs you can watch for in your souvenir shop.  Many of these “moves” overlap, so spotting a combination of behaviors is often the key.\\n\\n1. Concealing Merchandise  \\n  • Stashing items in bags, purses, pockets, or diaper bags  \\n  • Hiding goods in clothing (inside coats or layered garments)  \\n  • Using a “booster bag” lined with foil or plastic to defeat security tags or detectors  \\n  • Placing items in a stroller, shopping cart, or under a stroller seat  \\n\\n2. Tag- or Price-Switching  \\n  • Swapping price tags or barcodes between high-value and low-value items  \\n  • Removing or cutting off price or RFID tags in a fitting room or stall  \\n  • Carrying scissors or a sharp blade to remove tags quickly  \\n\\n3. Distraction or “Team” Theft  \\n  • One person engages staff in questions while another slips merchandise away  \\n  • Children used as decoys—kids might ask you to watch them, allowing accomplices to shoplift  \\n  • “Gift-wrap” distraction—asking for gift‐wrap or packaging while partner steals  \\n\\n4. Bulk-Grab or “Front-Loading”  \\n  • Rummaging through displays and stuffing multiple items into a bag or jacket  \\n  • Loading several items into a shopping bag or backpack en route to an exit  \\n  • Rolling up T-shirts or scarves to conceal them inside pockets  \\n\\n5. Refund and Returns Fraud  \\n  • Claiming to have bought an item elsewhere and asking for a refund or exchange  \\n  • Swapping out expensive souvenirs for cheaper or broken ones and returning the high-value piece  \\n  • Using a fake or old receipt to return stolen or shoplifted goods  \\n\\n6. Fitting Room Schemes  \\n  • Overloading fitting‐rooms with more merchandise than a customer could reasonably try on  \\n  • Wearing the stolen item under the customer’s own clothing (e.g. jewelry or a T-shirt)  \\n  • Leaving fitting rooms and walking around the shop so the item can be hidden elsewhere  \\n\\n7. “False Payment” Tricks  \\n  • Pretending to pay with a credit card—then slipping the item into a bag at the till  \\n  • Claiming the cashier short-changed them, causing a distraction  \\n\\nSuspicious Behaviors to Watch For  \\n  • Nervousness: Frequent glances over their shoulder; avoiding eye contact or staring at cameras  \\n  • Loitering: Standing in one spot or drifting aimlessly, especially near high-value displays  \\n  • Repetitive visits: Returning to the same display or product several times  \\n  • Bulky or baggy outerwear in warm weather  \\n  • Unaccompanied backpacks, large purses, or shopping bags not purchased in your store  \\n  • Overly talkative “help” from strangers or children who roam unsupervised  \\n  • People working in pairs or small groups splitting up and rejoining  \\n\\nPrevention Tips  \\n  • Greet every customer as they enter—sometimes a simple “Hello” is enough to deter casual shoplifters.  \\n  • Keep high-value items in sight lines of your counter and staff; consider locked or semi-locked displays.  \\n  • Use mirrors and good lighting to eliminate blind spots.  \\n  • Train staff to recognize these behaviors and to respond calmly: acknowledge the customer (“Can I help you find anything?”) rather than accusing.  \\n  • Maintain clear, uncluttered aisles so staff can move easily and see suspicious activity.  \\n  • Post visible “Shoplifting Prohibited” signs and let customers know you have CCTV or electronic tags.  \\n  • Develop a loss-prevention policy that balances customer service with attentive monitoring—empower employees to ask neutral questions rather than make outright accusations.  \\n\\nBy combining good store layout, vigilant—but friendly—staffing, and awareness of these common tactics, you’ll reduce your risk and make your souvenir shop a tougher target for shoplifters.'"

       "\"In seismic‐processing jargon a “zero‐phase” wavelet is one whose Fourier transform is everywhere real (i.e. its phase spectrum is identically zero), or equivalently a wavelet that is symmetric about its peak when you plot it centered at t = 0.  Although the causal Berlage wavelet  \\n   \\n   s(t) = tⁿ\\u2009e^(–αt)\\u2009cos(2πf₀\\u2009t + φ),   t ≥ 0  \\n   \\nlooks asymmetric in time, one can choose the constant phase φ (or equivalently shift the wavelet so its maximum sits at t = 0) in such a way that its entire spectrum becomes real.  \\n\\nHere's the key to why the spectrum can be forced real:  \\n1) The envelope tⁿ\\u2009e^(–αt) has a Fourier transform  \\n   \\n   F_env(ω) = ∫₀^∞ tⁿ\\u2009e^(–αt)\\u2009e^(–iωt)\\u2009dt = n!\\u2009/\\u2009(α + iω)^(n+1),  \\n   \\n   which carries a phase term –(n+1)\\u2009arctan(ω/α).  \\n2) Modulating by cos(2πf₀t + φ) splits the spectrum into two pieces centered at ±f₀, each of which carries that same –(n+1)\\u2009arctan((ω∓ω₀)/α) phase.  \\n3) If you pick φ = (n+1)\\u2009arctan(ω₀/α), the extra phase you’ve injected at the carrier exactly cancels the phase coming from the (α + i(ω∓ω₀))^(n+1) denominators.  When you add the two lobes you end up with a purely real sum for all ω.  \\n\\nIn practice one simply (a) chooses φ = (n+1)\\u2009arctan(f₀/α) (or equivalently (b) shifts the causal wavelet so its peak is at t = 0), and the resulting “Berlage wavelet” has zero phase.  Its amplitude spectrum remains that familiar tⁿ\\u2009e^(–αt)\\u2009cos–shaped bell, but with no phase‐distortion.\""

       "'In its fresh, unaltered state granite is essentially impermeable and has virtually no pore space, so it cannot act as a conventional oil reservoir the way a sandstone or limestone can.  Granite’s crystals are tightly interlocked, leaving almost zero primary porosity (storage space) and practically no permeability (open pathways).\\n\\nThat said, under the right circumstances even crystalline basement rocks, including granite, can hold hydrocarbons—but only in fractures or weathered zones, not in the intact rock matrix.  A few points to keep in mind:\\n\\n • Primary porosity vs. fracture porosity  \\n   – Primary porosity (the tiny gaps between grains/crystals) in granite is effectively zero.  \\n   – Fracture porosity (open cracks, joints, faults) can be significant if the rock is heavily fractured or brecciated.\\n\\n • Fractured-basement oil shows  \\n   – There are a handful of “basement” plays worldwide (East Java, parts of West Africa, offshore Canada) where oil or gas has been produced from fractured igneous or metamorphic rocks.  \\n   – Typically these are small, discontinuous accumulations controlled by fault zones or shear zones in the granite.\\n\\n • Weathered granite (“saprolite”)  \\n   – Near surface, granite can be chemically weathered into a loose, clay-rich saprolite that can have reasonable porosity.  \\n   – Very rarely, shallow oil shows have been reported in weathered basement, but commercial accumulations are virtually unknown.\\n\\n • Practical implications  \\n   – Even if fractures provide permeability, the total storage capacity is low (fracture porosities are usually <1\\u2009%), and it can be very hard to predict, drill, and exploit such traps.  \\n   – For these reasons the industry almost always looks first to sedimentary rocks (sandstones, carbonates, sometimes coals or shales) for reservoir targets.\\n\\nBottom line: granite itself is not a practical reservoir rock, but in a few exceptional cases heavily fractured or weathered granite has trapped hydrocarbons.'"

      "Catastrophe theory is a branch of applied mathematics—more specifically of bifurcation theory and singularity theory—that studies how small, smooth changes in the parameters of a system can cause sudden and dramatic (“catastrophic”) changes in its behavior or equilibrium states. It was pioneered in the 1960s by the French mathematician René Thom and further developed (and popularized) by E.C. Zeeman in applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Core idea  \n",
      "   • You have a system whose state x minimizes (or is a critical point of) some potential-like function V(x; α), where α = (α₁, α₂, …) are control parameters.  \n",
      "   • As you vary α slowly, the number or nature (stable vs. unstable) of equilibria (solutions of ∂V/∂x = 0) can change abruptly.  \n",
      "   • At certain critical parameter values, two or more equilibria coalesce or disappear in what is called a bifurcation or “catastrophe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Elementary catastrophes  \n",
      "   Under generic conditions (smooth functions, low-dimensional control space), Thom showed that there are only a handful of qualitatively distinct ways these sudden changes can occur.  In the case of up to four control parameters, the seven “elementary catastrophes” are:  \n",
      "   • Fold (1 control var.)  \n",
      "   • Cusp (2 control vars.)  \n",
      "   • Swallowtail (3 control vars.)  \n",
      "   • Butterfly (4 control vars.)  \n",
      "   • Elliptic umbilic (2 control vars, 2 state vars.)  \n",
      "   • Hyperbolic umbilic (2 control vars, 2 state vars.)  \n",
      "   • Parabolic umbilic (3 control vars, 2 state vars.)\n",
      "\n",
      "   Each has a simple “normal form” potential V(x; α) whose critical-point structure typifies that kind of sudden transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. A simple example: the cusp catastrophe  \n",
      "   Potential V(x; α, β) = x^4/4 + α x^2/2 + β x.  \n",
      "   • For certain (α, β) one finds one stable equilibrium; for others, three equilibria (two stable, one unstable).  \n",
      "   • The boundary between these regions is a cusp curve in the (α, β)-plane.  \n",
      "   • Crossing that boundary smoothly in parameter space causes a sudden jump in x.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Applications and limitations  \n",
      "   • Applications have been suggested in physics (phase transitions), biology (population crashes), ecology, economics (market crashes), psychology (decision-making “sudden shifts”), and more.  \n",
      "   • In practice, rigorous modeling requires verifying the existence of a potential function and checking genericity conditions.  Popular applications in the social sciences sometimes over-claim scope or fail to meet mathematical hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Mathematical framework  \n",
      "   • Singularity theory classifies critical points of families of functions under coordinate changes.  \n",
      "   • Thom’s theorem shows that, up to smooth coordinate changes in x and α, only finitely many “universal” singularities occur in low dimension.  \n",
      "   • One studies the “discriminant set” in parameter space—the locus of catastrophes—where the Jacobian and Hessian of V degenerate.\n",
      "\n",

Only once the team verifies that the application meets minimum security controls (e.g., authentication, encryption, logging) and complies with regulatory mandates (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) can it advance to procurement or development.\\n\\n2. As part of the qualification process, teams shall systematically consider open source alternatives before committing to a commercial solution. This evaluation covers code quality, license compatibility, and the health of the upstream community—factors including frequency of updates, vulnerability disclosures, and breadth of contributions. Total cost of ownership analyses shall compare commercial licensing fees and support contracts against the internal cost of maintaining, patching, and supporting an open source project. If an open source alternative can meet functional requirements and pass security reviews without introducing undue operational risk, it shall be given strong preference to avoid vendor lock-in and reduce long-term expenditures.\\n\\n3.

Belief that men are less “emotional” or easier to “manage”  \\n   •  The assumption: women are thought to be more prone to mood swings or interpersonal drama.  \\n   •  The effect: people claim men will fit in more smoothly with existing teams and avoid morale-undermining conflicts.\\n\\nNote: All three rationales are based on stereotype rather than evidence.

    "\n",
    "> In \"Lord of the Flies\" by William Golding, the story begins with the aftermath of a plane crash, where a group of boys are stranded on an uninhabited island. The first paragraph introduces the setting and the situation, focusing on the scar left by the crashed plane in the jungle. However, **I can't provide the exact text of the first paragraph as it is copyrighted material.** If you have a copy of the book, you can easily find this in the opening pages. Alternatively, I can help summarize the book or discuss its themes, characters, and more. Let me know how else I may assist you!\n"
