This is structured for clarity, enforceability, and alignment with common legal standards (e.g., U.S. EEOC guidelines, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act). **Disclaimer**: This is a general template, not legal advice. Consult employment lawyers and HR experts to tailor it to your jurisdiction, industry, company size, and specific needs. Laws vary by country/state (e.g., EU GDPR for data privacy, California's Fair Employment and Housing Act).\n",
       "\n",
       "## 1. Policy Statement\n",
       "[Your Company Name] is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where every employee feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their best. We prohibit discrimination, harassment, and retaliation based on protected characteristics including but not limited to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other status protected by law.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Our DEI Vision**: Build a workforce that reflects the diversity of our communities, ensures equal opportunities, and creates an environment of belonging.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Scope\n",
       "This policy applies to all employees, contractors, interns, vendors, and visitors at all company locations, events, and digital platforms. It covers recruitment, hiring, promotion, compensation, training, discipline, termination, and all other employment practices.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3. Definitions\n",
       "- **Diversity**: The presence of differences within a given setting (e.g., demographic, cultural, experiential).\n",
       "- **Equity**: Ensuring fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement by addressing systemic barriers.\n",
       "- **Inclusion**: Creating environments where diverse individuals feel welcomed, respected, supported, and able to thrive.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 4. Key Commitments and Actions\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4.1 Recruitment and Hiring\n",
       "- Use blind resume screening tools to reduce bias.\n",
       "- Partner with diverse talent pipelines (e.g., HBCUs, women's networks, disability-focused orgs).\n",
       "- Set diverse interview panels and inclusive job descriptions (e.g., avoid gendered language).\n",
       "- Track applicant demographics voluntarily (with opt-out) to monitor progress.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4.2 Training and Development\n",
       "- Mandatory annual unconscious bias and DEI training for all employees, with specialized sessions for managers.\n",
       "- Leadership development programs prioritizing underrepresented groups.\n",
       "- Mentorship and sponsorship programs pairing diverse talent with executives.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4.3 Compensation and Advancement\n",
       "- Conduct annual pay audits for equity across demographics.\n",
       "- Transparent promotion criteria with diverse selection committees.\n",
       "- Performance reviews incorporating 360-degree feedback to minimize bias.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4.4 Workplace Culture\n",
       "- Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) for affinities like LGBTQ+, BIPOC, women, veterans, etc., with company support (budget/time).\n",
       "- Inclusive holidays, events, and communications (e.g., celebrating multiple cultural observances).\n",
       "- Flexible work policies (e.g., remote options, parental leave) to support work-life balance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4.5 Accessibility and Accommodations\n",
       "- Ensure physical and digital accessibility (e.g., ADA-compliant offices, alt-text on websites).\n",
       "- Prompt response to reasonable accommodation requests (e.g., for disabilities, religious practices).\n",
       "\n",
       "## 5. Reporting and Accountability\n",
       "- **Reporting Mechanism**: Anonymous hotline, online portal, or HR email for concerns. No retaliation—violators face discipline up to termination.\n",
       "- **Investigation Process**:\n",
       "  1. Immediate acknowledgment (within 24 hours).\n",
       "  2. Impartial investigation by HR or third-party (within 10 business days).\n",
       "  3. Resolution and follow-up.\n",
       "- **Metrics and Reporting**: Annual DEI report shared internally (and publicly if applicable), tracking metrics like:\n",

       "  | Complaint Resolution    | 90% within 30 days      | Case logs                   |\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Leadership Accountability**: DEI goals tied to executive KPIs; annual audits.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 6. Enforcement and Consequences\n",
       "Violations will result in corrective action:\n",
       "- First offense: Training/counseling.\n",
       "- Repeat/repeated: Suspension/demotion.\n",
       "- Severe: Immediate termination.\n",
       "HR oversees enforcement; appeals go to senior leadership.\n",
