The response should point out that the values of the coefficients depend on the physical units for density and velocity. For example, if \alpha is assigned the value of 0.31 and \beta the value 0.25, then it is important that the units are explicitly specified in the function docstring or in the text as ft/s for velocity v and g/cm^3 for density \rho.","Any response that does not mention that the relation is empirical and the coefficients depend on units."
"science","I am performing a classification task with scikit-learn. I need to standardize the features. I will use k-fold cross-validation but still need to split out a holdout set for final testing.
