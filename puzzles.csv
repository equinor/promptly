"There are  two cities: one, a city of 'knights', and the other of 'knaves'. Knights are always truthful, while knaves always lie. The residents of the two cities like to visit each other. One day, a man enters one of the cities, but doesn’t know which. He decides to ask the first person he meets a question to figure out where he is. Remembering that the knights and knaves visit each other's cities, what question can he ask in order to know definitely which city he is in?","Do you live here?","If I were to ask a resident of this city if they are a knight, what would they say?"

"I have 5 well logs with 10,000 samples, 1 sample every 15.24 cm. I want to train a linear regression model to predict porosity from these logs. How can I split out a 'blind' dataset to evaluate my model against?","Because the samples are almost certainly correlated to each other, splitting randomly will leak information into the test set. This may result in overestimating model performance. You could try splitting the data into two blocks, but this may mean the two datasets have different distributions. Alternatively, find more data.","Shuffle the data and split it randomly"
"Who should interpret 3D reflection seismic data, geologist or geophysicist?","Both of them should contribute to the interpretation","The geologist"
"I need to compute density from velocity. Can you implement Gardner's relation in Python?","The response should include a valid, idiomatic Python function implementing the equation: \rho = \alpha * v**\beta (other variable names are allowed but these are typical). The response should point out that the values of the coefficients depend on the physical units for density and velocity. For example, if \alpha is assigned the value of 0.31 and \beta the value 0.25, then it is important that the units are explicitly specified in the function docstring or in the text as ft/s for velocity v and g/cm^3 for density \rho.","Any response that does not mention that the relation is empirical and the coefficients depend on units."
"I am performing a classification task with scikit-learn. I need to standardize the features. I will use k-fold cross-validation but still need to split out a holdout set for final testing. Can you show me how to do the splitting and the scaling?","The response should include Python code that splits the dataset, then prepares a pipeline containing the StandardScaler. This way, the scaling will happen on each split in the k-fold cross-validation step.","Any answer that scales the training set without using a pipeline"
"I am performing a classification in scikit-learn. The target property has three labels with 512, 340 and 28 records respectively. Can you show me how to split out a holdout set?","The answer must mention the strong imbalance in the labels, and must pass the label data to train_test_split() as the `stratify` argument","Any response that does not mention the imbalance or use the stratify argument"
