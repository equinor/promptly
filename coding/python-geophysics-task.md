## Initial prompt
    I have this Ricker wavelet function. Give me a flat list of
    all of the ways in which it can be improved. Do not use headings,
    do not provide an improved function.


    def r(f):
        t = range(0, 0.2, 0.004)
        pft = (-3.141 * f * t)^2
        return 1 - 2 * pft * 2.71828^(-pft)

## Suggest fixes
    Write a new function that fixes all of these issues.
    Provide only the function itself, no commentary
    outside the function definition.

## Suggest further improvements
    Are there any outstanding issues with the function as it stands now?
    For example, are there other improvements you would recommend?
    (Return only a flat list of suggestions, no improved code.)

## Ask for implementation of most of it
    Implement all of these in a new function, except for the automatic
    scaling of duration and the  suppression of the DC component.
    Prefer the named tuple option to the dataclass.

## Find the bug
_NB the algorithm usually does not assure that there is an odd number of samples._

    I tried using this with t, w = ricker_wavelet(25, 0.127, 0.001) but
    using the wavelet seems to introduce a small phase shift.
    What could be the issue?

## Fix the bug
_If the system finds and suggests a fix for the bug._

    Fix this issue.

## Write another function
    Write a function for the Gabor wavelet using the same patterns.
